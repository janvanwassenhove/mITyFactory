# My Application Principles

## 🧭 Guiding Values

These principles guide development decisions for My Application.

---

## Principle 1: User-Centric Design

> "Build for the user, not for the technology."

Every feature should solve a real user problem.

---

## Principle 2: Test Everything

> "If it's not tested, it's broken."

Comprehensive testing prevents regressions and enables refactoring.

---

## Principle 3: Automate the Routine

> "Humans should do creative work, machines should do routine work."

Automate repetitive tasks to reduce errors and free up time.

---

## Principle 4: Measure Impact

> "Data drives decisions."

Collect metrics to understand how features are used.

---

## Principle 5: Iterate Quickly

> "Ship early, learn fast, improve continuously."

Small, frequent releases are better than big, infrequent ones.

---

## Principle 6: Keep It Simple

> "Complexity is the enemy of reliability."

Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements.

---

## Principle 7: Own Your Services

> "You build it, you run it."

Teams are responsible for the services they create.

---

## Principle 8: Document Decisions

> "Future you will thank present you."

Record why decisions were made, not just what was decided.
