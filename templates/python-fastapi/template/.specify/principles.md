# {{app_name}} Design Principles

## 🧭 Guiding Values

These principles guide development decisions for {{app_name}}.

---

## Principle 1: API-First Design

> "The API contract is the foundation."

Design APIs before implementation. OpenAPI spec drives development.

---

## Principle 2: Test-Driven Development

> "If it's not tested, it's broken."

Write tests before or alongside implementation. Tests are documentation.

---

## Principle 3: Async by Default

> "Never block the event loop."

Use async/await for all I/O operations. The server must remain responsive.

---

## Principle 4: Explicit Over Implicit

> "Configuration should be visible."

Use environment variables. Avoid magic defaults. Make dependencies explicit.

---

## Principle 5: Fail Fast, Recover Gracefully

> "Errors should be immediate and informative."

Validate inputs at boundaries. Return helpful error messages.

---

## Principle 6: Security as Standard

> "Security is not an afterthought."

Authenticate all endpoints. Validate all inputs. Never trust external data.

---

## Principle 7: Observable Operations

> "If you can't measure it, you can't improve it."

Log all significant events. Expose metrics. Make debugging possible.

---

## Principle 8: Simplicity Wins

> "The best code is no code."

Solve the problem at hand. Avoid over-engineering. Delete dead code.

---

## Application to Development

### When writing code:
- Ask: "Does this follow the API contract?"
- Ask: "How will this fail? How will we know?"
- Ask: "Can this be simpler?"

### When reviewing code:
- Check: Tests cover the change
- Check: Error handling is complete
- Check: No security concerns
