# {{app_name}} Design Principles

## 🧭 Guiding Values

These principles guide development decisions for {{app_name}}.

---

## Principle 1: Clean Architecture

> "Dependencies point inward."

Controllers depend on Services. Services depend on Repositories. Domain is independent.

---

## Principle 2: Test-Driven Development

> "If it's not tested, it's broken."

Write tests before or alongside implementation. Tests are documentation.

---

## Principle 3: Dependency Injection

> "Don't call us, we'll call you."

Use constructor injection. Let Spring manage the lifecycle. Keep components loosely coupled.

---

## Principle 4: Explicit Configuration

> "Configuration should be visible and overridable."

Use `application.yml`. Support profiles. Make defaults sensible.

---

## Principle 5: Fail Fast, Recover Gracefully

> "Errors should be immediate and informative."

Validate inputs at boundaries. Use proper exception hierarchy. Return helpful error responses.

---

## Principle 6: Security as Standard

> "Security is not an afterthought."

Authenticate all endpoints. Validate all inputs. Never trust external data.

---

## Principle 7: Observable Operations

> "If you can't measure it, you can't improve it."

Use Spring Actuator. Log all significant events. Expose meaningful metrics.

---

## Principle 8: Simplicity Wins

> "The best code is no code."

Solve the problem at hand. Use Spring's features wisely. Avoid over-engineering.

---

## Application to Development

### When writing code:
- Ask: "Does this follow clean architecture?"
- Ask: "How will this fail? How will we know?"
- Ask: "Is there a Spring feature for this?"

### When reviewing code:
- Check: Tests cover the change
- Check: No circular dependencies
- Check: Security annotations present
