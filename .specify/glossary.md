# mITyFactory Glossary

## A

### A11Y (Accessibility)
Short for "accessibility" (11 letters between 'a' and 'y'). Refers to making software usable by people with disabilities. mITyFactory targets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
A document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

### Agent
A deterministic handler responsible for a specific SDLC role (Analyst, Architect, Implementer, etc.).

### A11y Agent
A specialized factory agent responsible for accessibility auditing. It scans HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance issues, validates ARIA usage, and suggests remediation. Consulted during UI-related changes at the Review station.

### ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
A set of HTML attributes that define ways to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities, especially when using assistive technologies.

## C

### Container
An isolated execution environment (Docker/Podman) used to run toolchain commands.

### Crate
A Rust compilation unit. mITyFactory is organized as a workspace of multiple crates.

## D

### Definition of Done (DoD)
A checklist of criteria that must be satisfied before a feature can be considered complete.

## F

### Factory
The complete mITyFactory system that orchestrates application creation.

### Feature
A discrete unit of functionality specified in the Spec Kit and tracked through the SDLC workflow.

## G

### Gate
A quality checkpoint that evaluates whether work meets defined criteria before proceeding.

## I

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
Terraform or other code-based infrastructure definitions generated by the factory.

## M

### Manifest
A YAML/JSON file describing configuration or metadata (e.g., template manifest).

## P

### Policy
Rules that govern code quality, security, and compliance (e.g., no secrets in code).

## R

### Runner
The container execution subsystem that manages Docker/Podman interactions.

## S

### SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)
The complete workflow from specification to deployment: Analyze → Architect → Implement → Test → Review → Secure → DevOps → IaC → Gate.

### Spec Kit
The `.specify/` directory containing all project specifications including constitution, principles, features, and ADRs.

### Station
A single step in the workflow that processes artifacts and produces results.

## T

### Template
A project scaffold (e.g., python-fastapi) that can be instantiated to create new applications.

## W

### Workflow
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of stations that processes work through the SDLC.

### WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
International standard for web accessibility. mITyFactory targets WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for all UIs.

### Workspace
A Cargo/Rust concept for organizing related crates. Also refers to the root project directory.
