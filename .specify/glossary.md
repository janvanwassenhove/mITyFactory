# mITyFactory Glossary

## A

### A11Y (Accessibility)
Short for "accessibility" (11 letters between 'a' and 'y'). Refers to making software usable by people with disabilities. mITyFactory targets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
A document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. Located in `docs/adr/`.

### Agent
A deterministic handler responsible for a specific SDLC role (Analyst, Architect, Implementer, Tester, Reviewer, Security, DevOps, Designer, A11y).

### A11y Agent
A specialized factory agent responsible for accessibility auditing. It scans HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance issues, validates ARIA usage, and suggests remediation.

### ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
A set of HTML attributes that define ways to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities, especially when using assistive technologies.

### Autopilot
A mode in the chat system that enables autonomous factory execution with user interrupt capability. Executes the SDLC pipeline without requiring manual approval at each step.

## C

### Chat Session
A persistent conversation with the factory's agent system. Sessions are saved to the filesystem and can be resumed across restarts.

### Container
An isolated execution environment (Docker/Podman) used to run toolchain commands.

### Cost Tracking
Built-in mechanism for tracking LLM token usage and estimating costs during factory operations. Supports multiple currencies (USD, EUR).

### Crate
A Rust compilation unit. mITyFactory is organized as a workspace of 10 crates.

## D

### Definition of Done (DoD)
A checklist of criteria that must be satisfied before a feature can be considered complete.

## F

### Factory
The complete mITyFactory system that orchestrates application creation.

### Feature
A discrete unit of functionality specified in the Spec Kit and tracked through the SDLC workflow.

## G

### Gate
A quality checkpoint that evaluates whether work meets defined criteria before proceeding. Accessed via `mity quality-gate`.

## I

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
Terraform configurations generated by the factory for AWS, Azure, and GCP deployments.

### Intake
The guided process in the chat system for creating new applications, gathering requirements through conversation.

## L

### LLM (Large Language Model)
External AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic) optionally integrated for enhanced analysis and code generation. The factory works with or without LLM keys.

## M

### Manifest
A YAML file describing configuration or metadata. The template manifest (`templates/manifest.yaml`) defines all available templates.

## P

### Policy
Rules that govern code quality, security, and compliance. Defined in `policies/*.yaml`.

### Provider
An LLM service provider (OpenAI, Anthropic) that can be configured per-agent in the factory settings.

## R

### Runtime
The factory's execution state including timeline events, cost tracking, and agent outputs.

### Runner
The container execution subsystem (`mity_runner` crate) that manages Docker/Podman interactions.

## S

### SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)
The complete workflow from specification to deployment: Analyze → Architect → Implement → Test → Review → Secure → DevOps → IaC → Gate.

### Spec Kit
The `.specify/` directory containing all project specifications including constitution, principles, testing requirements, governance, features, and glossary.

### Station
A single step in the workflow that processes artifacts and produces results.

## T

### Template
A project scaffold that can be instantiated to create new applications. Available templates include Python FastAPI, Java Spring Boot, Java Quarkus, .NET Web API, frontend frameworks, and fullstack combinations.

### Timeline
A real-time event stream in the UI showing factory progress, agent actions, and status updates.

## W

### Workflow
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of stations that processes work through the SDLC.

### WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
International standard for web accessibility. mITyFactory targets WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for all UIs.

### Workspace
A Cargo/Rust concept for organizing related crates. Also refers to the root project directory or user project directories.
